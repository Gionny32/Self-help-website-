          <h1>What I Do.</h1>
          <p>Inside Matters was started to release evidence based content out into the internet that is current, relevant and reliable. It aims to inspire a holistic health approach to eating and exercise.</p>
          <p>My professional experience started in 2010 by graduating Coventry University with a BSc (hons) in Nutrition and Dietetics. Since Graduating, I have gained experience of Clinical Dietetics within the hospital and community environment over 9 years.<br><br>  My specialty is within Mental Health Dietetics, working into a multidisciplinary team, supporting teenagers to recover from Eating Disorders. My own personal ‘Mindfulness journey’ started by completing a 8-week Mindfulness program and this continued on by embarking on a Yoga Alliance Certified Teacher Training course of Fall 2019. Continuing my passion for nutrition, since moving to the United States last year, I am in the process of completing a MSc in Clinical Nutrition from Aberdeen University.<br><br>My clinical experience, alongside behaviour change skills and motivational interviewing training have enabled me to be a successful Dietitian and I will continue to build on this by completing my training as a qualified Yoga Alliance Instructor. Writing is also a passion of mine, being able to share stories and using these skills for writing engaging content about science. </p>
